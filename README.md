This project is built with React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. It demonstrates how to set up and connect a React app to a Node.js backend, allowing you to create and manage a dynamic web application.

**Prerequisites**
    Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
    1. Node.js (v22.12.0)
    2. npm

**Installation**

   1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
      
     https://github.com/vrundacvaghasiya/Centra_Quiz.git
     cd Centra_Quiz

   2.Install backend dependencies: Navigate to the backend directory and install the necessary packages:

      cd centra_quiz_platform
      npm install

  3.Install frontend dependencies: Navigate to the frontend directory and install the necessary packages:

      cd centra_quiz
      npm install
      

**Usage**

1. Start the backend server: Navigate to the backend directory and run:
	
       cd centra_quiz_platform
       nodemon App.js
   
   This will start the Node.js API server on port 3002

2. Start the frontend application: Navigate to the frontend directory and run:
    
       cd centra_quiz
       npm start

This will start the React app on http://localhost:3000.
